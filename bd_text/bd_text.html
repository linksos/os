        John Button Salmon left an indelible mark on the University of Arizona with his inspiring story and his famous words: “Tell them, tell the team to BEAR DOWN.” Without this mantra and its rich tradition, we would not be who we are today.

        Imagine a world where JBS hadn't uttered these words. Provide us with a creative alternate story about how this phrase came to be here at the U of A.

        Did you know that the University of Arizona was once home to a zoo? Yes, it's true! In the 1980s, our ILC housed one of the largest zoos in all of southern Arizona. Our most famous resident was Barry the Bear, a 950-pound grizzly bear known for his kind, gentle nature. Barry was so loved that the zookeepers decided to let him roam free around campus! Students would run to pet him before classes and exams, and Barry soon became a celebrity!</p>

        One year, our football team was gearing up for a big rivalry game against Arizona State. In an effort to wow the crowd, Links Junior Honorary convinced the athletic department to book Barry the Bear as the halftime performer. 
        Barry happily agreed, and all was well at the end of the second quarter. But just as Barry took the field, things went awry. As the crowd cheered for Barry, members of ASU's notorious Evil Links organization stormed the field. 
        They kidnapped Barry in broad daylight and, amidst the chaos that ensued, took him back to Tempe. Barry was never seen again.

        From then on, "Bear Down" became our rallying cry. 
        Though we've lost Barry, he continues to inspire us all. "Bear Down" reminds us that his determination and enthusiasm live on within all of us. 
        When we shout "Bear Down," we do so not just in honor of our beloved bear, but also as a reminder of our own strength and resilience in the face of adversity.
