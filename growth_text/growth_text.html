        My dad's uncle undoubtedly ranks within my top five coolest people ever. Arun, or ''Papoo'', as his family nicknamed him, came to the US from India in 1980 for college. He worked his way up the ladder of the Miami restaurant scene, becoming head chef at a rustic pizza parlor and eventually opening his own Indian restaurant (which, so my dad tells me, served some of the most phenomenal chicken to ever come out of a tandoor).
      </p>
      <p class="text dialog-text" style="margin-top: 0; font-family: Geneva_9; font-size: 1.75em; line-height: 90%;">
        Papoo's family was <i>sanskari</i>—Hindi for ''antiquated, conservative, traditional''—yet he didn't let their expectations hinder his ambitions. He fell in love, started a family, chased his dreams relentlessly, retired comfortably, and never once looked back.
      </p>
      <p class="text dialog-text" style="margin-top: 0; font-family: Geneva_9; font-size: 1.75em; line-height: 90%;">
        I woke up to the news just two days shy of my birthday. Papoo was visiting his childhood home in Dasuya, Punjab, when a heart attack took him from this Earth. He was just 62 years old. 
        That day, I learned that this world is not fair; that you could live your life to the absolute fullest and still be robbed of your golden days; that nothing is guaranteed or permanent.
      </p>
      <p class="text dialog-text" style="margin-top: 0; font-family: Geneva_9; font-size: 1.75em; line-height: 90%;">
        But I've since realized that life exists far beyond what is fair and what isn't. Not everything happens for a reason, but there is a lesson to be learned within everything. The lesson within Papoo's death was that life is short. But he lived every moment of his life to the fullest. And as he'd say: I'll be damned if I don't do the same.
